<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Competition is generally considered to be of utmost importance in modern market economies, as it motivates businesses to make their products available at comparably low prices, which entails a cost efficient way of production and distribution, in addition to a high degree of innovation.<sup><a id="anker1" ref="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> That is the reason why competitive markets are usually not regulated by an external authority.<sup><a id="anker2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> However, there are cases where such authorities deem it necessary to intervene. The authorities can intervene be-cause of competition law. Competition law constraints the behaviour of businesses and limits prac-tices that are anti-competitive.<sup><a id="anker3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Sherman defines in his book Market regulation competition policy as: <q>[Competition] policy generally regulates competition and preserves its role in guiding econom-ic decisions so they serve the general welfare</q>.<sup><a id="anker4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> He shows the core reason why competition policy exists, namely, to maintain or even increase general welfare.</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">One such case, where an authority thought it necessary to intervene, was the tying of the Windows Media Player (WMP) and Windows Operating System (Windows) by the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), which the European Commission (EC) convicted as an abuse of a dominant market position, which is illegal under Article 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).<sup><a id="anker5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> In 2004, the EC sentenced Microsoft to pay €497 million as a fine for their illicit practice after a five year investigation, which was the highest fine for a competition law violation at that time.<sup><a id="anker6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> On top of that, Microsoft had to offer a version of their operating system (OS) without the Windows Media Player pre-installed.<sup><a id="anker7" ref="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The EC decision, Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft<sup><a id="anker8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>, itself states that Microsoft has infringed two different rules, the first being the tying of WMP with the Windows OS, the second being the refusalto supply information on Microsoft workgroup servers.<sup><a id="anker9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> However, only the case of the illegal tying will be discussed below.<sup><a id="anker10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
