<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">As mentioned above, competition is a driving force for the functioning of a market, since it provides incentives for businesses to compete on the merits, i.e. the quality and the price of the product or service, and new innovations, in order to meet the consumerâ€™s needs and increase the consumer welfare.<sup><a id="anker10" ref="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> In a perfectly competitive market, regulation by an external entity is not necessary and could even have negative effects.<sup><a id="anker11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> However, the majority of markets are not perfectly competitive. There can be cases, where a single or a small group of companies control the market and use that control to increase their own welfare at the expense of the consumers and competitors. For cases like these, the European Union set out rules that specify when and how an authority may intervene in a market. These rules can be found in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Arti-cle 102 TFEU relates to cases where a company abuses its market position to enhance its own gains.</p></font>
