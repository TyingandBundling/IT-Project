<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The conduct of an undertaking that sells its product under the condition that the customer must buy another product with it is commonly defined as tying.<sup><a id="anker12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> The product that the customer initially wants to buy is referred to as the tying product, whereas the product that must be purchased with the tying product is called the tied product.<sup><a id="anker13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> Motta uses in his book Competition Policy the example where a travel agent sells a plane ticket only together with a reservation of a hotel room to explain the practice of tying.<sup><a id="anker14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> The products can be either tied physically, so that there is no possibility to buy one product without the other, which is also called technical tying, or they can be tied contrac-tually, where a contract declares that the customer has to buy the tied product jointly with the tying product.<sup><a id="anker15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup></p></font>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">On the other hand, “[b]undling usually refers to the way products are offered and priced […]”.<sup><a id="anker16" ref="#fn16">[16]</a></sup> In the case of pure bundling, the seller offers the products only together in fixed proportions.<sup><a id="anker17" href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup> A situation in which the products are also offered individually, but the sum of the individual prices is high-er compared to the price when they are sold together, is referred to as mixed bundling.<sup><a id="anker18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup></p></font>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Both of these practices are common and widespread.<sup><a id="anker19" href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> Tying and bundling may enable the seller of the product to use economies of scale or better ways of distribution, which will decrease the price of the products.<sup><a id="anker20" href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup> Also, a bundle may have a greater value and utility for consumers than the individual products purchased separately.<sup><a id="anker21" href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup> The European Commission acknowledges these potential positive aspects of tying and bundling in paragraph 49 in its Article 102 Guidance Paper.<sup><a id="anker22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> These benefitsshow that consumers may profit from these practices, as the perceived quality and price of tied or bundled products can be greater than without tying or bundling. That is the reason why tying and bundling is not illegal per se. As mentioned above, Article 102 TFEU only prohibits these practices if they are performed by undertakings with a dominant position in the market. Non-dominant under-takings are free to tie and bundle their products. Dominant companies are prohibited from tying and bundling because it gives them the opportunity to leverage their market power.<sup><a id="anker23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup> Leverage of market power means, that the company “uses its position on the market where it is dominant to fore-close competition on another market and acquire substantial market power there too”.<sup><a id="anker24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> So, costum-ers buy the tying product, as they do not have a great chance to find the same product somewhere else due to the dominance of the company in that product market, and consequently buy the tied product as well, since they do not have an incentive or even an opportunity to look for an alternative product in the tied product market. This will lead to an elimination of competition in the tied prod-uct market and can lead to higher prices for consumers and increased barriers to entry for potential or actual competitors in that market.<sup><a id="anker25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup></p></font>
