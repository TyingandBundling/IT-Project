<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Competition is generally considered to be of utmost importance in modern market economies, as it motivates businesses to make their products available at comparably low prices, which entails a cost efficient way of production and distribution, in addition to a high degree of innovation.<sup><a id="anker1" ref="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> That is the reason why competitive markets are usually not regulated by an external authority.<sup><a id="anker2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> However, there are cases where such authorities deem it necessary to intervene. The authorities can intervene be-cause of competition law. Competition law constraints the behaviour of businesses and limits prac-tices that are anti-competitive.<sup><a id="anker3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Sherman defines in his book Market regulation competition policy as: <q>[Competition] policy generally regulates competition and preserves its role in guiding econom-ic decisions so they serve the general welfare</q>.<sup><a id="anker4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> He shows the core reason why competition policy exists, namely, to maintain or even increase general welfare.</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">One such case, where an authority thought it necessary to intervene, was the tying of the Windows Media Player (WMP) and Windows Operating System (Windows) by the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), which the European Commission (EC) convicted as an abuse of a dominant market position, which is illegal under Article 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).<sup><a id="anker5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> In 2004, the EC sentenced Microsoft to pay €497 million as a fine for their illicit practice after a five year investigation, which was the highest fine for a competition law violation at that time.<sup><a id="anker6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> On top of that, Microsoft had to offer a version of their operating system (OS) without the Windows Media Player pre-installed.<sup><a id="anker7" ref="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The EC decision, Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft<sup><a id="anker8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>, itself states that Microsoft has infringed two different rules, the first being the tying of WMP with the Windows OS, the second being the refusalto supply information on Microsoft workgroup servers.<sup><a id="anker9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> However, only the case of the illegal tying will be discussed below.<sup><a id="anker10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">As mentioned above, competition is a driving force for the functioning of a market, since it provides incentives for businesses to compete on the merits, i.e. the quality and the price of the product or service, and new innovations, in order to meet the consumer’s needs and increase the consumer welfare.<sup><a id="anker10" ref="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> In a perfectly competitive market, regulation by an external entity is not necessary and could even have negative effects.<sup><a id="anker11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> However, the majority of markets are not perfectly competitive. There can be cases, where a single or a small group of companies control the market and use that control to increase their own welfare at the expense of the consumers and competitors. For cases like these, the European Union set out rules that specify when and how an authority may intervene in a market. These rules can be found in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Arti-cle 102 TFEU relates to cases where a company abuses its market position to enhance its own gains.</p></font>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The conduct of an undertaking that sells its product under the condition that the customer must buy another product with it is commonly defined as tying.<sup><a id="anker12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> The product that the customer initially wants to buy is referred to as the tying product, whereas the product that must be purchased with the tying product is called the tied product.<sup><a id="anker13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> Motta uses in his book Competition Policy the example where a travel agent sells a plane ticket only together with a reservation of a hotel room to explain the practice of tying.<sup><a id="anker14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> The products can be either tied physically, so that there is no possibility to buy one product without the other, which is also called technical tying, or they can be tied contrac-tually, where a contract declares that the customer has to buy the tied product jointly with the tying product.<sup><a id="anker15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup></p></font>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">On the other hand, “[b]undling usually refers to the way products are offered and priced […]”.<sup><a id="anker16" ref="#fn16">[16]</a></sup> In the case of pure bundling, the seller offers the products only together in fixed proportions.<sup><a id="anker17" href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup> A situation in which the products are also offered individually, but the sum of the individual prices is high-er compared to the price when they are sold together, is referred to as mixed bundling.<sup><a id="anker18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup></p></font>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Both of these practices are common and widespread.<sup><a id="anker19" href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> Tying and bundling may enable the seller of the product to use economies of scale or better ways of distribution, which will decrease the price of the products.<sup><a id="anker20" href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup> Also, a bundle may have a greater value and utility for consumers than the individual products purchased separately.<sup><a id="anker21" href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup> The European Commission acknowledges these potential positive aspects of tying and bundling in paragraph 49 in its Article 102 Guidance Paper.<sup><a id="anker22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> These benefitsshow that consumers may profit from these practices, as the perceived quality and price of tied or bundled products can be greater than without tying or bundling. That is the reason why tying and bundling is not illegal per se. As mentioned above, Article 102 TFEU only prohibits these practices if they are performed by undertakings with a dominant position in the market. Non-dominant under-takings are free to tie and bundle their products. Dominant companies are prohibited from tying and bundling because it gives them the opportunity to leverage their market power.<sup><a id="anker23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup> Leverage of market power means, that the company “uses its position on the market where it is dominant to fore-close competition on another market and acquire substantial market power there too”.<sup><a id="anker24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> So, costum-ers buy the tying product, as they do not have a great chance to find the same product somewhere else due to the dominance of the company in that product market, and consequently buy the tied product as well, since they do not have an incentive or even an opportunity to look for an alternative product in the tied product market. This will lead to an elimination of competition in the tied prod-uct market and can lead to higher prices for consumers and increased barriers to entry for potential or actual competitors in that market.<sup><a id="anker25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup></p></font>

</ol>

<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">During the case the European Commission establishes, and the Court of First Instance upholds, four elements that are required before tying prohibited under Article 102 TFEU can be determined.<sup><a id="anker26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup> These elements are:</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(i) the company must be in a dominant position in the tying product market<sup><a id="anker27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(ii) the tying and tied products must be separate products61<sup><a id="anker28" href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(iii) customers do not have a choice to purchase the tying product without the tied product<sup><a id="anker29" href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(iv) the tying forecloses competition.<sup><a id="anker30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Objective Justification of the conduct is another element that the EC does not explicitly list as nec-essary for the determination of the existence of tying.<sup><a id="anker31" href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">To establish dominance the EC first has to define the relevant product market, as mentioned above. The tying product market in this case is the market for PC operating systems, where Microsoft ad-mits that it is indeed in a dominant market position.<sup><a id="anker32" href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> By 1996, Microsoft has achieved a market share of over 70% in the market of new operating system licenses for PCs and continued to increase that market share to over 90% by the turn of the millennium.<sup><a id="anker33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> Another factor that supports Mi-crosoft’s dominance in the market for PC operating systems is the high barriers to entry caused by indirect network effects.<sup><a id="anker34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> Network effects increase the value of a product to a consumer the more other consumers use it as well.<sup><a id="anker35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup> In the case of operating systems, these network effects are indirect, since developers and content creators of software applications tend to design these applications for the OS with the most users, as the likelihood to produce the most sales increases with the number of users of that OS.<sup><a id="anker36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup> Furthermore, the higher the amount of software applications for an OS is, the more popular it becomes with users.<sup><a id="anker37" href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup> Consequently, the higher the number of users of an OS is, the more software applications are developed for it, which will increase the number of users again.<sup><a id="anker38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> The European Commission points out, that “[t]his creates a self-reinforcing dynamic that protects Windows as the de facto standard for PC operating systems […]”.<sup><a id="anker39" href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup> Combining the two elements of very high market share and barriers to entry, the EC decides that the first condition of illegal tying under Article 102 TFEU is fulfilled.<sup><a id="anker40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The second precondition for illegal tying under Article 102 TFEU, tying and tied product must be distinct from each other, is more difficult to establish, as virtually all products are in some kind bundled or tied with other products.<sup><a id="anker41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> For example, new shoes are sold with shoelaces or a car can be broken down into various components that are tied together, or a computer bought from an Orig-inal Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), which manufacture and sell PCs to end consumers, consists of a number of hardware parts and software. Microsoft argues in the same way, as it states in its appeal to the EC’s decision, that the operating system and WMP are not distinct products, since WMP is an integral part of the OS.<sup><a id="anker42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup> Microsoft further claims, that there is no demand for operating systems without pre-installed media players anymore because consumers are now used to have a media player without acquiring it specifically after the purchase of the PC.<sup><a id="anker43" href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup> However, the CFI re-jects Microsoft’s line of argument and approves of the European Commission’s decision.<sup><a id="anker44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> In the Article 102 Guidance Paper, the EC explains how it tests for the existence of separate products. It uses “customer demand”<sup><a id="anker45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup> for the test. For the EC, two products are separate if customers would buy the tying product without the tied product in a situation with no tying, which in turn would al-low for stand-alone production for both products.<sup><a id="anker46" href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup> This test is rather controversial, as no objective economic model can be used to establish the distinctness of tying and tied products.<sup><a id="anker47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> The EC and the CFI, however, are convinced that WMP and Windows are separate products because independ-ent producers of media players manufacture alternatives to WMP even after four years of allegedly illegal tying of WMP and Windows, which implies that there is a demand for the tied product.<sup><a id="anker48" href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> Furthermore, Microsoft produces versions of WMP for other operating systems.<sup><a id="anker49" href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup> On top of that, the company even “promotes WMP in direct competition with third party media players.”<sup><a id="anker50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup> These factors are sufficient for the European authorities to conclude that the tying and tied products are distinct and the second precondition of illegal tying is therefore fulfilled.</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The third precondition, the lack of customer choice, is rather obviously fulfilled. OEMs do not have a choice to license Windows without the Windows Media Player.<sup><a id="anker51" href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup> Other media players can only be installed by OEMs in addition to WMP.<sup><a id="anker52" href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup> The same holds true for consumers, who buy Windows in a store.<sup><a id="anker53" href="#fn53">[53]</a></sup> These facts speak for the presence of coercion, i.e. Microsoft forces its customers to ac-quire the tied product, WMP, with the tying product, Windows. Microsoft, on the other hand, dis-putes the allegation of coercion in view of the fact that it does not charge any extra money for WMP and does not actually force Windows users to employ WMP, as there is no restriction for the users to install other media players.<sup><a id="anker54" href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup> The EC reasons, in regards to these arguments, that paying an addi-tional charge for a tied product is not a prerequisite for the element of coercion, as the fact alone that the customer is obliged to also acquire the WMP when he wants to purchase Windows is enough for the fulfilment of coercion, even if the customer does not have to pay extra for the tied product.<sup><a id="anker55" href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup> Also, Commission states, that the only fact that matters for the element of coercion is, that the customers automatically obtain the WMP as soon as they purchase Microsoft’s operating system, which places competitors in the media player product market at a competitive disad-vantage.<sup><a id="anker56" href="#fn56">[56]</a></sup> Simultaneously, the general customer has little to no incentive to look for another option of a media player when they already obtain one by purchasing Windows, even if they have the op-tion to do so like Microsoft argues.<sup><a id="anker57" href="#fn57">[57]</a></sup> Thus, the EC sees the element of coercion as satisfied.</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The fourth element to establish illegal tying is that the tying of WMP forecloses competition. The EC deduces that Microsoft meets the element due to the fact that the tying of WMP grants it to be present on over 90% of all PCs in Europe.<sup><a id="anker58" href="#fn58">[58]</a></sup> In turn, software developers and content providers have the incentive to mainly use WMP as the sole base for their products since it is costlier for them to produce their goods for multiple media players.<sup><a id="anker59" href="#fn59">[59]</a></sup> This leads to consumers to primarily use WMP, since more software and content is available for that media player compared to others.<sup><a id="anker60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup> So, the network effects become obvious, and in the view of the EC the effects “seriously undermin[e] the competitive process in the media player market.”<sup><a id="anker61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Microsoft argues that the tying is objectively justified, as the efficiencies from the tying are greater than the anti-competitive effects from the practice, and therefore not illegal under Article 102 TFEU.<sup><a id="anker62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> The EC, on the other hand, disagrees and rejects Microsoft’s argument, since the efficien-cies of having a pre-installed media player gained by the consumer does not require the preselection of the media player done by Microsoft.<sup><a id="anker63" href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Concluding, the Commission finds Microsoft guilty of tying prohibited under EU competition law. The practice places Microsoft at a significant competitive advantage achieved by an abuse of its dominant market position. As such, the consumer welfare is harmed because “the normal competi-tive process […] in terms of quicker cycles of innovation due to unfettered competition on the merits”<sup><a id="anker64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></sup> is hindered.</p></font>
