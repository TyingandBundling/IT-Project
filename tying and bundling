<font size="4"><p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">During the case the European Commission establishes, and the Court of First Instance upholds, four elements that are required before tying prohibited under Article 102 TFEU can be determined.<sup><a id="anker26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup> These elements are:</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(i) the company must be in a dominant position in the tying product market<sup><a id="anker27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(ii) the tying and tied products must be separate products61<sup><a id="anker28" href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(iii) customers do not have a choice to purchase the tying product without the tied product<sup><a id="anker29" href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">(iv) the tying forecloses competition.<sup><a id="anker30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Objective Justification of the conduct is another element that the EC does not explicitly list as nec-essary for the determination of the existence of tying.<sup><a id="anker31" href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">To establish dominance the EC first has to define the relevant product market, as mentioned above. The tying product market in this case is the market for PC operating systems, where Microsoft ad-mits that it is indeed in a dominant market position.<sup><a id="anker32" href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> By 1996, Microsoft has achieved a market share of over 70% in the market of new operating system licenses for PCs and continued to increase that market share to over 90% by the turn of the millennium.<sup><a id="anker33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> Another factor that supports Mi-crosoft’s dominance in the market for PC operating systems is the high barriers to entry caused by indirect network effects.<sup><a id="anker34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> Network effects increase the value of a product to a consumer the more other consumers use it as well.<sup><a id="anker35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup> In the case of operating systems, these network effects are indirect, since developers and content creators of software applications tend to design these applications for the OS with the most users, as the likelihood to produce the most sales increases with the number of users of that OS.<sup><a id="anker36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup> Furthermore, the higher the amount of software applications for an OS is, the more popular it becomes with users.<sup><a id="anker37" href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup> Consequently, the higher the number of users of an OS is, the more software applications are developed for it, which will increase the number of users again.<sup><a id="anker38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> The European Commission points out, that “[t]his creates a self-reinforcing dynamic that protects Windows as the de facto standard for PC operating systems […]”.<sup><a id="anker39" href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup> Combining the two elements of very high market share and barriers to entry, the EC decides that the first condition of illegal tying under Article 102 TFEU is fulfilled.<sup><a id="anker40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The second precondition for illegal tying under Article 102 TFEU, tying and tied product must be distinct from each other, is more difficult to establish, as virtually all products are in some kind bundled or tied with other products.<sup><a id="anker41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> For example, new shoes are sold with shoelaces or a car can be broken down into various components that are tied together, or a computer bought from an Orig-inal Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), which manufacture and sell PCs to end consumers, consists of a number of hardware parts and software. Microsoft argues in the same way, as it states in its appeal to the EC’s decision, that the operating system and WMP are not distinct products, since WMP is an integral part of the OS.<sup><a id="anker42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup> Microsoft further claims, that there is no demand for operating systems without pre-installed media players anymore because consumers are now used to have a media player without acquiring it specifically after the purchase of the PC.<sup><a id="anker43" href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup> However, the CFI re-jects Microsoft’s line of argument and approves of the European Commission’s decision.<sup><a id="anker44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> In the Article 102 Guidance Paper, the EC explains how it tests for the existence of separate products. It uses “customer demand”<sup><a id="anker45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup> for the test. For the EC, two products are separate if customers would buy the tying product without the tied product in a situation with no tying, which in turn would al-low for stand-alone production for both products.<sup><a id="anker46" href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup> This test is rather controversial, as no objective economic model can be used to establish the distinctness of tying and tied products.<sup><a id="anker47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> The EC and the CFI, however, are convinced that WMP and Windows are separate products because independ-ent producers of media players manufacture alternatives to WMP even after four years of allegedly illegal tying of WMP and Windows, which implies that there is a demand for the tied product.<sup><a id="anker48" href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> Furthermore, Microsoft produces versions of WMP for other operating systems.<sup><a id="anker49" href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup> On top of that, the company even “promotes WMP in direct competition with third party media players.”<sup><a id="anker50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup> These factors are sufficient for the European authorities to conclude that the tying and tied products are distinct and the second precondition of illegal tying is therefore fulfilled.</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The third precondition, the lack of customer choice, is rather obviously fulfilled. OEMs do not have a choice to license Windows without the Windows Media Player.<sup><a id="anker51" href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup> Other media players can only be installed by OEMs in addition to WMP.<sup><a id="anker52" href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup> The same holds true for consumers, who buy Windows in a store.<sup><a id="anker53" href="#fn53">[53]</a></sup> These facts speak for the presence of coercion, i.e. Microsoft forces its customers to ac-quire the tied product, WMP, with the tying product, Windows. Microsoft, on the other hand, dis-putes the allegation of coercion in view of the fact that it does not charge any extra money for WMP and does not actually force Windows users to employ WMP, as there is no restriction for the users to install other media players.<sup><a id="anker54" href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup> The EC reasons, in regards to these arguments, that paying an addi-tional charge for a tied product is not a prerequisite for the element of coercion, as the fact alone that the customer is obliged to also acquire the WMP when he wants to purchase Windows is enough for the fulfilment of coercion, even if the customer does not have to pay extra for the tied product.<sup><a id="anker55" href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup> Also, Commission states, that the only fact that matters for the element of coercion is, that the customers automatically obtain the WMP as soon as they purchase Microsoft’s operating system, which places competitors in the media player product market at a competitive disad-vantage.<sup><a id="anker56" href="#fn56">[56]</a></sup> Simultaneously, the general customer has little to no incentive to look for another option of a media player when they already obtain one by purchasing Windows, even if they have the op-tion to do so like Microsoft argues.<sup><a id="anker57" href="#fn57">[57]</a></sup> Thus, the EC sees the element of coercion as satisfied.</p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">The fourth element to establish illegal tying is that the tying of WMP forecloses competition. The EC deduces that Microsoft meets the element due to the fact that the tying of WMP grants it to be present on over 90% of all PCs in Europe.<sup><a id="anker58" href="#fn58">[58]</a></sup> In turn, software developers and content providers have the incentive to mainly use WMP as the sole base for their products since it is costlier for them to produce their goods for multiple media players.<sup><a id="anker59" href="#fn59">[59]</a></sup> This leads to consumers to primarily use WMP, since more software and content is available for that media player compared to others.<sup><a id="anker60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup> So, the network effects become obvious, and in the view of the EC the effects “seriously undermin[e] the competitive process in the media player market.”<sup><a id="anker61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Microsoft argues that the tying is objectively justified, as the efficiencies from the tying are greater than the anti-competitive effects from the practice, and therefore not illegal under Article 102 TFEU.<sup><a id="anker62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> The EC, on the other hand, disagrees and rejects Microsoft’s argument, since the efficien-cies of having a pre-installed media player gained by the consumer does not require the preselection of the media player done by Microsoft.<sup><a id="anker63" href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup></p>

<p style="font-family:Palatino Linotype;">Concluding, the Commission finds Microsoft guilty of tying prohibited under EU competition law. The practice places Microsoft at a significant competitive advantage achieved by an abuse of its dominant market position. As such, the consumer welfare is harmed because “the normal competi-tive process […] in terms of quicker cycles of innovation due to unfettered competition on the merits”<sup><a id="anker64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></sup> is hindered.</p></font>
